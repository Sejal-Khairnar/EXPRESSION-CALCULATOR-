# EXPRESSION-CALCULATOR-
Expression Calculator is a C program that evaluates mathematical expressions entered in infix notation (like 3 + 4 * (2 - 1)). It first converts the expression into postfix  notation using a stack-based Shunting-Yard algorithm, then evaluates the postfix form with another stack.
